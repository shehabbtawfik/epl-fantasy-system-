## PART B: EXPECTED POINTS MODELING

### Model Architecture

The xPts model uses a multi-component approach combining:

1. **Base Scoring Rate** (per-90 minutes)
2. **Minutes Prediction** (availability & rotation)
3. **Fixture Adjustments** (difficulty & venue)
4. **Set Piece Bonuses** (penalties, corners, free-kicks)
5. **Form Adjustments** (recent vs season performance)
6. **Risk Modifiers** (cards, rotation risk)

### Model Formula

```
xPts_next_gw = (predicted_minutes / 90) × base_points_per_90 × fixture_adjustment + bonuses + adjustments

Where:
- base_points_per_90 = 2 + attacking_points_per_90 + defensive_points_per_90 + bonus_points_per_90
- attacking_points_per_90 = (goals_per_90 × position_goal_value) + (assists_per_90 × 3)
- defensive_points_per_90 = clean_sheet_points + save_points - conceded_penalty
- fixture_adjustment = difficulty_multiplier + home_advantage
- bonuses = set_piece_bonus + form_adjustment
- adjustments = risk_adjustment (cards, rotation)
```

### Model Weights

| Parameter | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| base_points_weight | 0.40 | Core scoring rate importance |
| form_weight | 0.25 | Recent form vs season average |
| fixture_weight | 0.20 | Opponent difficulty impact |
| minutes_weight | 0.15 | Playing time prediction |
| set_piece_bonus | 0.50 | Corner/free-kick takers |
| penalty_bonus | 1.00 | Penalty takers |
| home_advantage | 0.30 | Home venue bonus |
| rotation_risk | -0.20 | Squad rotation penalty |

### Top 5 xPts Predictions (Next GW)

| Player | Position | Team | Price | xPts |
|--------|----------|------|-------|------|
| Matty Cash | DEF | AVL | £4.5 | 8.68 |
| Tyrone Mings | DEF | AVL | £4.5 | 8.68 |
| Lucas Digne | DEF | AVL | £4.5 | 8.55 |
| Ezri Konsa Ngoyo | DEF | AVL | £4.5 | 6.34 |
| Amadou Onana | MID | AVL | £5.0 | 4.52 |

### Backtest Results

**Validation Method:** Current season points-per-game vs predicted xPts  
**Sample Size:** 118 players (with sufficient playing time)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | 1.99 |
| Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) | 2.94 |
| Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) | 90.2% |
| Correlation | 0.365 |

**Interpretation:** The model shows moderate predictive power with reasonable correlation. High MAPE is expected at season start due to limited data.

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Most Sensitive Parameters:**

| Parameter | Sensitivity Score | Impact |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| home_advantage | 0.207 | High impact on predictions |
| penalty_bonus | 0.107 | Moderate impact |
| rotation_risk | 0.022 | Low impact |

**Key Insights:**
- Home advantage has the highest sensitivity - venue significantly affects predictions
- Penalty taker status provides meaningful but controlled bonus
- Rotation risk has minimal impact, suggesting good baseline minutes prediction
